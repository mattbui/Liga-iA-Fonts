This folk trying to add ligatures & nerd fonts to iA-Fonts

- Add ligatures with [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer)
- Add nerd fonts with [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

In `ligatures.py` is my selected FiraCode's ligatures and character glyphs that worked best for iA font, consider to use this for the ligaturizer. Set `COPY_CHARACTER_GLYPHS = True` in `build.py` of the ligaturizer
